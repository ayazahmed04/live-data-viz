# LiveDataViz

**LiveDataViz** is a real-time data visualization dashboard that fetches live data from APIs and visualizes it using interactive charts. This project combines Python for backend API development and JavaScript (React, D3.js, or Plotly) for frontend visualization.

## Features
- Real-time data fetching and visualization.
- Interactive dashboards with filtering options.
- Supports multiple types of charts (line, bar, scatter, etc.).
- Export charts or data to CSV or image files.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python (Flask or Django).
- **Frontend**: React, D3.js/Plotly/Chart.js.
- **Database**: SQLite (optional for storing persistent data).

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Node.js and npm

### Backend Setup
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd backend
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Flask/Django server:
   ```bash
   python app.py   # For Flask
   python manage.py runserver  # For Django
   ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Connecting Frontend and Backend
- Update the API URL in the frontend code to point to your backend server.

## How to Run
1. Start the backend server.
2. Start the frontend server.
3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the appropriate port).

## Roadmap
- Add more chart types and visualizations.
- Improve the UI/UX with advanced interactivity.
- Deploy the application to a cloud service.
